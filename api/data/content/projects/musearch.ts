        `Art is an essential part of human culture and has been for thousands of years. It is a powerful form of self-expression that allows us to communicate our emotions, thoughts, and ideas. Art can provide us with a deeper understanding of the world around us. It encourages creativity and imagination, which are essential for personal growth and inspires us to think outside the box and come up with new ideas and solutions. Art can have therapeutic benefits, helping us to relax and reduce stress.`,
        `Knowing all these benefits of communing with art, will we be surprised that as many as <strong>68% of the Americans avoid museums?</strong> The <strong>three main reasons</strong> are: the belief that <strong>there is nothing interesting</strong> for them, <strong>difficulty in finding a place</strong> that will match their interests and <strong>negative precedent experiences</strong> such as queues.`,
